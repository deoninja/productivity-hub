    text: "Atomic Habits by James Clear emphasizes that improving by just 1% each day leads to remarkable results over time. These small, seemingly insignificant changes compound, much like compound interest, to create a massive difference in the long run. Conversely, getting 1% worse daily can lead to a significant decline.",

If you have trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you, but your system. You don't rise to the level of your goals; you fall to the level of your systems.",

When your habits align with your desired identity, they become deeply ingrained and more sustainable. Every action you take is a 'vote' for the type of person you wish to become.",

Strategies: Use a habit scorecard to become aware of your current habits, implement 'habit stacking' (linking a new habit to an existing one, e.g., 'After I brush my teeth, I will meditate for one minute'), and design your environment to make good habit cues prominent. To break bad habits, make them invisible (remove cues).",
